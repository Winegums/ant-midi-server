# Device/Sensor Data Log Reader

## Usage
- Place logs with convention: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-Name.txt` (Example: `2020-08-28-Device0.txt`) within a directory with the desired "device name"
- `cd` to this parent directory (`device-data-reader`)
- `python parse_dev0.py`

## TODO
- Paramaterize for input device name (folder name)
